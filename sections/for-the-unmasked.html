                        For The Unmasked. You kill all the masked overlords using the same masks that they wield to free
                        the unmasked ones from their mind control.

                        This Project was initially made in 48 hours but it is back in development as we plan to take all
                        of
                        the feedback given to us from the game jam and create a full fledged demo of our original
                        ambitious idea. I will write what we already have in the released version of the game down
                        below.
                        Though The game is taking a pivot into making sure that we expand on what made the game
                        enjoyable based on the players' feedback

                                    abilities, different paths will be more or less effective.</p>

                                <p>With a team of 6 and a very small window of 48 hours, the scope of the game had to be
                                    managed carefully. It's a fairly large team for a game jam, so we had to make sure
                                    everyone had something to do and that we weren't biting off more than we could chew.

                            The combat was designed to be fast paced and fluid. The player can switch between masks
                            instantly, allowing for quick combos and attacks using the different kits the masks provide.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The player has a base kit which is shared across everything, from grunts to bosses and even
                            the player.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I designed the combat with very tight instructions given to the animator for the attack
                            timings to ensure that the combat felt snappy and responsive.

                        <p>
                            With only 48 hours to design and build the game, the level had to be designed with very
                            tight
                            constraints. Working with an agile system I quickly prototyped the level using basic shapes
                            to
                            test the flow and pacing of the game. Then proceeded with dressing up the level with the
                            time I
                            had left.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The level was designed to be non-linear and provide multiple paths for the player to take.
                            Based on the player's choice and their available abilities, different paths will be more or
                            less effective. That way theres some level of replayability and player agency. As we work
                            more
                            on the game this objective will be expanded on more to make sure that replayability and
                            player
                            agency are at the forefront of the level design.

                        <p>
                            When working with 6 (2 Programmers, 1 Designer/Developer, 2 3D Animators/Artists, 1 2D
                            Artist) people on a game jam, it's important to make sure that everyone has
                            something to do and that we're not biting off more than we can chew. With most of us working
                            together for the first time we needed to make sure that we were all on the same page and
                            that we were able to communicate effectively.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I took on the role of team lead and was responsible for making sure that everything was
                            documented and communication was seamless within the team. With the time constraint of 48
                            hours, having as much details for each task as possible was crucial to making sure that we
                            didnt have to make multiple revisions for the same task.
